# security-headers-tool
 A security headers tool is a software application or online service designed to analyze and evaluate the security headers implemented on a website or web application. These tools inspect HTTP response headers sent by a web server to ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect against various types of attacks and vulnerabilities.

# Security Headers Tool

The Security Headers Tool is a Python script that analyzes HTTP response headers to identify missing or misconfigured security headers. It helps web developers and security professionals ensure that websites implement essential security measures.

## Scripts

- `check_headers.py`: Analyzes HTTP response headers for security settings.
- `check_specific_header.py`: Checks for specific security headers in HTTP responses.
- `spider.py`: Web crawler to collect URLs for testing.

## Supported Security Headers and Significance

The tool checks for the following security headers and explains their significance:

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Specifies approved sources for content, protecting against XSS and data injection attacks.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables or disables the browser's XSS protection.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Ensures that browsers only access a website over HTTPS, preventing protocol downgrade attacks.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling if and how a page can be loaded within a frame or iframe.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.

Each security header contributes to enhancing the security posture of a web application by mitigating specific types of attacks.

## Usage

To use the scripts, ensure you have Python installed. Install any required dependencies with:
