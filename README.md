## Scripts

- `check_headers.py`: Analyzes HTTP response headers for security settings.
- `check_specific_header.py`: Checks for specific security headers in HTTP responses.
- `spider.py`: Web crawler to collect URLs for testing.

## Supported Security Headers and Significance

The tool checks for the following security headers and explains their significance:

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Specifies approved sources for content, protecting against XSS and data injection attacks.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables or disables the browser's XSS protection.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Ensures that browsers only access a website over HTTPS, preventing protocol downgrade attacks.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling if and how a page can be loaded within a frame or iframe.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.

Each security header contributes to enhancing the security posture of a web application by mitigating specific types of attacks.

## Usage

To use the scripts, ensure you have Python installed. Install any required dependencies with:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cipherkrish69x/security-headers-tool.git
   cd security-headers-tool

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Set Up Your Environment:
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website if needed.

2. Install Necessary Libraries:
Use pip to install the requests library, which will be used for making HTTP requests and inspecting response headers.

-	pip install requests
  
3. Understanding the Script:
The check_security_headers function sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, retrieves the response headers, and checks for the presence of required security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.).
If any required header is missing from the response, it is added to the missing_headers list.
The script prompts the user to enter a URL to test (target_url) and calls the check_security_headers function with the provided URL.
Running the Script:
Save the script as security_header_checker.py.
5Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing security_header_checker.py, and run the script using Python:

-	python security_header_checker.py
  
Enter a URL (e.g., https://example.com) when prompted to test the tool against the specified web application.
6. Interpreting the Output:
The script will analyze the HTTP response headers of the specified URL and display a list of missing or misconfigured security headers if any are found.
Review the output to identify which security headers are not properly configured or are missing from the web application's HTTP response.
Enhancements and Customization:
Additional Headers: Modify the required_headers list to include other security headers based on your requirements.

Step 1: Setup Environment
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary libraries (requests for HTTP requests and argparse for command-line parsing). 

-	pip install requests argparse 

Step 2: Refactor Existing Script
If you already have a basic script for checking security headers (security_header_checker.py), refactor it into modular functions that can be reused within an interactive CLI

Step 3: Create an Interactive CLI Script

Create a new Python script (e.g., enhanced_security_header_checker.py) that includes an interactive command-line interface (CLI) using the argparse library to handle user inputs and options.

The check_security_headers function performs the header checks for a given URL and returns a string result indicating the presence or absence of the Referrer-Policy header (or other headers you wish to check).
The main function parses command-line arguments using argparse, including the URL to check and an optional --output-file argument for specifying the output file path.
After performing the header check, the script checks if the --output-file argument was provided. If so, it writes the result to the specified output file using a with statement to ensure proper file handling (the file is automatically closed after writing).

3. Run the Script Correctly
After setting the correct shebang line and ensuring executable permissions, run the script using the appropriate command:
./check_headers.py --urls-file urls.txt --headers-file headers.txt --output-file output.json

Significance of JSON Output in check_headers.py:

Example JSON Output:
The output.json file generated by check_headers.py might contain structured data similar to the following format:

Benefits of JSON Output:
Data Persistence: JSON output allows for persistent storage and retrieval of results.
Portability: JSON files can be easily shared and transported between different systems.
Flexibility: JSON output can be processed and analyzed using a wide range of tools and libraries.

2.Use the --help Option:
Incorporate a built-in help menu (--help option) using argparse

-	python check_headers.py --help
Users can view a summary of available options, command syntax, and usage instructions directly from the command line.
